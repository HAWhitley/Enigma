# Enigma Machine
A recreation of the Nazi Enigma Machine paired with a decryption mechanism using frequency analysis


Prototypes:

Plugboard - Enter a message that goes through the plugboard.

Rotor1 - Enter a message that goes through the plugboard and the right rotor. This only implements single stepping.

Rotor2 - Enter a message that goes through the plugboard, the right rotor, and the middle rotor. This only implements single stepping.

Rotor3 - Enter a message that goes through the plugboard, the right rotor, the middle rotor, and the left rotor. This only implements single stepping.

Reflector - Enter a message that goes through the plugboard, the right rotor, the middle rotor, the left rotor, and the reflector. This only implements single stepping.

FullSingleStep - Enter a message that goes through the plugboard, the right rotor, the middle rotor, the left rotor, the reflector, the left rotor again, the middle rotor again, the right rotor again, and the plugboard again. This only implements single stepping.



Final Product:

FullDoubleStep - Enter a message that goes through the plugboard, the right rotor, the middle rotor, the left rotor, the reflector, the left rotor again, the middle rotor again, the right rotor again, and the plugboard again. This implements double stepping.
